## About Us
Hey world, we are the **World Data League team**!
Most of us come from the Data Science field and what connects us is the belief that applying data to problems can genuinely impact society. We believe in the power of communities and that it’s possible to achieve much more when we unite our strengths and skills and work together.
Our team has experience creating online and offline communities and organising kick-ass events and competitions for technical audiences. Why are we doing this? We want to create a global community of data scientists that compete to solve social-oriented problems while having lots of fun.

### Our Values
- We are global
- We are a League
- We don’t do bullshit
- We help data scientists
