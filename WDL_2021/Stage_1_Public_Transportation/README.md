# Stage 1 - Public Transportation
According to the 2017 UNâ€™s Global Mobility Report, it is predicted that by 2030 the annual passenger traffic will exceed 80 trillion passengers-kilometres. That means an increase of 50% compared to 2015, as well as an additional 1.2 billion cars on the road.
As cities grow, thereâ€™s an urge for an efficient public transportation system. In this stage, we want to look into this problem from two perspectives.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1 - Churn model for public transports
The goal in this challenge is to create a framework that will allow to measure the increase and decrease the passengers of public transport towards cities that are more inclusive and sustainable.

### Challenge 2 - Model of integrated transports for senior citizens
In this challenge, we want to understand the senior citizens' mobility patterns and their characteristics: We aim to provide better conditions of mobility for our senior citizens, giving them the same opportunities to arrive at their points of interest with affordable and accessible public transport.
