## Challenges

### Challenge 1 - Predicting traffic flow in a city using induction loop sensors
The goal of this challenge is to create an explainable prediction of when heavy flow and congestions in the city will happen.

### Challenge 2 - Identification of patterns and prediction of irregular parking
The goal in this challenge is to improve parking surveillance to dissuade irregular parking.

### Challenge 3 - Patterns and predictive modelling of traffic accidents
The goal of this challenge is to understand the causes and anticipate traffic accidents.

### Challenge 4 - Identifying road segments with potential safety hazard
The goal is to understand which areas of the city of Porto and/or Lisbon are riskier in terms of safety, excluding traffic accidents.
