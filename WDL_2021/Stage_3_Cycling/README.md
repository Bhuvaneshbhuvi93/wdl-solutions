## Challenges

### Challenge 1 - Predicting the demand for shared bicycles
The goal is to create a model that allows us to make system load balancing decisions based on demand forecasting based on historical data. Load balancing means the planning of transporting bicycles from one station to another.

### Challenge 2 - (Literally) Paving the way towards safer cities
The goal of this challenge is to map the pavement quality in the city of Lisbon, in terms of ability to cycle.

### Challenge 3 - Missing Links - Closing the circuit in existing cycle networks
The goal of this challenge is to find the opportunities to create a stronger cycling network and help make cities easier to cycle. By doing so, the city will become more accessible, with better air quality and improved physical levels and health of the citizens.
