## Challenges

### Challenge 1 - Reduce environmental and health impacts of pollution from mobility
The goal in this challenge is to relate the hourly levels of pollution with the Intensity Traffic Model of each Metropolitan Area (Lisbon and Porto) and modelling these two dimensions.

### Challenge 2 - Attracting population to green spaces in metropolitan areas
The goal in this challenge is to create a model that predicts the daily average demand of a green space and which factors contribute the most to the prediction.

### Challenge 3 - Optimisation of outdoor advertising in cities
In this challenge, we want to create a model that optimises the number and location of the outdoor advertising positions in order to minimize the visual impact in urban environments. A better dimensioning and integration of outdoor advertising positions in cities should also be considered.

### Challenge 4 - Predicting Air Quality for Outdoor Activities
The goal in this challenge is to create a model that considers the data collected from the system, in correlation with other infrastructure, to identify daily the best nearby spots in each neighbourhood to do outdoor activities.
