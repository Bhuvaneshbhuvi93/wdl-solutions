## ✨ Introduction (250 words max)
Trash is collected every week and in 2016 cities generated 2.01 billion tons of solid waste. It is necessary to manage the waste to reduce the contamination of the cities. Austin has more than 400 datasets, including about waste. for this reason, this city is ideal to create a prediction model about generation of waste and its manage.

## 🔢 Data (250 words max)
We used a dataset with Daily Waste Collection Report for Austin (provided by WDL). Our study is based in this dataset, but it was poor, because it had a few data, and all data was about a week of December of 2020. We looked for other dataset, but we didn't find any dataset. Only, we find a map with drop off of Austin, but this map only have localitation, it doesn't have any data to train models.

## 🧮 Methods and Techniques (250 words max)
We used a prediction model based on forecasting. We focused in time series models, becuase all data depended on time. We tested with Arima model, and bayesian models. But we needed more time to test other models and other ideas, for example, models with maps to implicate the route type and type of waste.

## 💡 Main Insights (300 words max)
The most of the waste is garbage collections type. 
The days of week with more production os waste are Thrusday and Friday.
