# Stage 2 - Transportation and Mobility
A well built and functioning public transport system can reduce the number of cars and therefore improve air quality and reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. It also has a social role - It gives mobility opportunities to the ones that do not have the possibility of owning or driving a car. Therefore a well functioning public transport system of a city is a vital environmental and social link, but it only works if well optimized.

## Challenges

### Optimization of public transport routes during road interruptions
The goal of this challenge is to model, from the point of view of trends, which routes of the transport road network suffer the most cuts/disturbance due to interventions on public roads. It was intended to evaluate the effort needed to adapt our services to match the network's needs in the presence of disruptions due to physical obstacles preventing circulation along usual routes. Additionally, the goal was to evaluate and quantify levels of the perception of "inconvenience" by network users caused by different disruptions.

### Predicting the flow of people for public transportation improvements
The goal of this challenge was to focus on data to study how to improve the city's public infrastructure to help reduce traffic, improve urban sustainability and quality of life for its citizens.
