## Introduction


According to the World Bank, cities produced 2.01 billion tons of solid waste in 2016. 
This corresponds to around 0.74 kg/day per individual! With the rapid growth of cities, 
this is only expected to increase. One of the major problems of a poor waste collection is its contribution to air pollution which 
has a direct influence on the quality of living conditions. Therefore, it is critical to optimize waste collection
operations and provide more targeted public education on domestic waste management and separation.
To improve waste collection, new solutions and strategies are necessary machine-learning based tools have shown potential in identifying waste trends and producing an
explainable model for predicting future waste production. Futhermore, such methods may assist 
in estimating the impact of simpler solutions such as implementing a Stop-Start System in 
high-capacity waste delivery trucks [1]. It is estimated that by implementing this system 
might save rougly 38,332 kgCO2eq, which is comparable to growing 1900 trees for one year [2].

## Data (250 words max)


The main dataset used was suggested daily waste collection report for Austion. In addition, route description data was also leveraged. The most interesting improvement would be an increase in waste collection resolution, from daily/route drop off weight to weight at each collection point.

##  Product
### Definition
A machine-learning-based tool to assist in the optimization of waste collection and transport.

### Users 
The users will be the Austin Resource Recovery department to better plan and schedule waste collections on-demand instead of having pre-defined frequent collections.

### Activities 
* Predict the weight of collectable garbage for each transport route per day

Describe what features your product has.
Example:
* Predicts the most likely locations for traffic accidents
* Suggests the fastest route from dispatch centres

### Output $
Describe what the product outputs to the users and how it does that. You can add mockups and/or visualisations.
Example: Location of the accident on a map and suggest the fastest route from the dispatch centre.

## Social Impact Measurement $$$$$
### Outcome
If the outputs are your immediate results, describe your long-term results. What do you want your product to achieve? What ''good'' are you creating?
Example: To decrease response time from dispatchers so that people in urgent need receive help faster.

### Impact Metrics
From the outcome, define **2 to 4 metrics** that measure if you are achieving that outcome or not.
Example:
* Average Dispatch Time
* Average Distance from Accident Location and Dispatch Center

### Impact Measurement
Since you cannot wait to see the impact of your product, estimate it. You can do that by either using the estimations/predictions of your model, market research, products from proxy industries and/or similar locations, etc.

Example:
* *Based on model predictions*: Our model estimates a decrease of 6 minutes of the average dispatch time and a decrease of the average distance of 200 meters
* *Based on proxy products*: Similar studies in other cities show that the dispatch time can be decreased by as much as 13 minutes, depending on the traffic intensity of that city.
