## 🛠️ Product
### Definition
-Vizualise the use of public transportation in Porto and then know where to place, in an optimal way, e-scooter drop-off zones in Porto.

### Users
Porto city, to improve public transportation.

### Activities
* Optimization of e-scooter drop-off zone.

### Output
Idea: ptimal location of e-scooter drop-off zones on a map thanks to optimization. First we need to select current e-scooters of interest, create a first tab with location and number of e-scooters at this location and then create a distance matrix between all these locations.

## 🌍 Social Impact Measurement
### Outcome
Keep tracking the evolution of e-scooter use because optimal drop off zones can change overtime.

### Impact Metrics
Respect optimization constraints. 

### Impact Measurement
No model was made.
