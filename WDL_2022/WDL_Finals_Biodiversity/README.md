# Finals - Biodiversity
According to UN-Habitat, cities occupy only 2% of the total Earth's land surface but use 75% of the planetâ€™s resources. Urban growth has also been responsible for 16% of the natural habitat loss between 1992 and 2000. Major intergovernmental scientific reports  (e.g. IPCC, IPBES) clearly demonstrate the crisis of accelerating nature loss due to our actions. On the other hand, a well-developed urban biodiversity can help us with many of our pollution targets. A well-connected network of green spaces, or biodiversity corridors, in and around a city, together with a conscious effort to reduce urban sprawl, can do much to mitigate the impact that the city has on nature in its region.

## Challenges

### Identification of Dark Ecological Corridors
The goal of this challenge was to reduce the impact of ALAN on the bats in the city of Bristol and therefore reduce its adverse effect on the ecosystem. The output of this challenge was to be applied to the decision making on which lighting needs to be turned off.
